# 👋 Hi there, I'm Thomas

I like building things—sometimes useful, sometimes just for fun 🚀. I'm usually tinkering with new ideas, shipping projects, or trying out tools I haven't used before. I'm into software engineering, machine learning, and everything in between. Lately, I've been enjoying cooking, playing soccer, and listening to podcasts (I like the Huberman Lab).
